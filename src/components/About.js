            Hello! my name is Xiaoyi. I just graduated from UC Berkeley EECS in
            May 2021 and living in San Francisco. I enjoy using technology to
            solve real life problems. During my time at Berkeley, my interests
            were mainly in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. After
            graduated, in order to create more accessible applications, I
            started to learn the front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript and React.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In addition to programming, in my free time, I will play scientific
            experiments with my sons, listen to folk music, cook spicy food, and
            wait for the new season of Rick and Morty.
