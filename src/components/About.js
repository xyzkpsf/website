            Hello! I'm Xiaoyi, who just graduated from UC Berkeley EECS in May
            2021 and living in San Francisco. I enjoy using technology to solve
            or help the real life problems, and making it interesting if
            possible. During my time at Berkeley, my interests were mainly in
            the fields related to machine learning and artificial intelligence.
            After graduated, in order to create more accessible applications, I
            started to learn the front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript and React.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to programming, in my free time, I will play scientific
            experiments with my sons, listen to folk music, cook spicy food, and
            wait for the new season of Rick and Morty.
